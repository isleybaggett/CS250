How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To determine user needs I first sit down and have a conversation about what they are looking for in their bussiness. I also take a look at the customer perspective and what they want. I take these "stories" and make user stories and prioritize them based off what is most important to my client. I can then make these testable and estimable so I can provide a timeline and cost to the client. Then for my sprint team these products become smaller tangiable pieces in the product backlog for creation. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I really liked the using scrum as a agile approach. Having the independence as a developer, yet still being able to bring up my concerns during a morning meeting is important to me. Having a open product backlog to see also gives me trust in those above me and gives me the confidence in what im working on and where the product is going. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

In my opinion a good team member is one who is independent, but can collaborate when he needs to. Making sure your challenging yourself but not to the point that others are having to pick up the slack on your behalf. Overall, being a professional who understands their work is the most important to me.
